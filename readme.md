# Please read before you Push !!!

To keep the repo clean, we will use some the industry standard of forking from the parent repo and pushing code to our personal forks first.

**Do not push directly to this repo**. Make your own Fork, use the pull request feature, and wait for your code to be accepted. If you don't know how to, ask.
